##A simple demo implementing the Factory Method pattern in Java

###Below are the instructions:
###Design Patterns
These are the specifications for labs for each of the design patterns we are covering.

Each part builds upon the previous part to demonstrate how design patterns can work together

###Unit Tests

To ensure that your implementation meets the desired requirements, remember to write tests for each behavior you are implementing. Following the principles of Test Driven Development will help to ensure a functioning end product at the end of these labs.

###Instructions

###Factory

###Part 1:

Implement the Factory Method pattern in the hierarchy for CupDispenser to mirror that of the DrinkDispenser. You should implement subclasses CoffeeCupDispenser, BeerGlassDispenser, and SodaCupDispenser. You may also want to implement the classes CoffeeCup, BeerGlass and SodaCup.

###Part 2:

Follow the Abstract Factory pattern to complete the hierarchy for the DispensingSystem. Include at least two concrete dispensing systems of your choice and fill in any missing components needed. (Eg: if you want to make a BeerDispensingSystem you will need to create the Beer and BeerDispenser classes, which we did not make yet)
